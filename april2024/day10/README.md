## Day10: physical -> Wooden architecture blocks to show universities damage in the Gaza strip
I used 7 architectural building blocks to symbolize the 7 major universities of the Gaza strip and show 2 where still standing as of April 2024 based on an NBC News investigation.
I posted an updated version of the visual a few days later, after reading an UN News story saying all universities are destroyed in the Gaza strip.
